		data-scope parameter specifies what google resources we want to be able to access. Google documentation for OpenId shows that it asks for name, email and profile picture. 
		data-redirecturi sets a post message, enables the one-time use code flow
		data-accesstype = offline means taht our server can make requests to Google API server even if the user is not logged in
		data-cookiepolicy determines the scope of the URIs that can access the cookie. We use the single host origin, if our website only has a single host name, and no subdomains
		data-callback parameter specifies a callback function. If a user clicks and grants our application access to their profile, this callback method is called, and given the one time use code along with an access token. 
		data-approvalprompt = force means that our user has to login each time we visit the login page and doesn't check to see if they're logged in already. Useful for debugging. Usually disabled for production as it can be annoying. -->
